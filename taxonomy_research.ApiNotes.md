# Research Topics in Information Taxonomy and Coherence

## Derived vs. Acquired: A Fundamental Taxonomy

The distinction between derived and acquired information represents a fundamental taxonomy in information processing:

- **Derived Information**: Obtained through direct algorithmic analysis of primary sources (e.g., code)
- **Acquired Information**: Obtained through interpretation of secondary human-created artifacts (e.g., discussions, issue reports)

This taxonomy provides valuable insight into information provenance and reliability characteristics.

## Research Questions and Future Directions

### 1. Information Weighting and Prioritization

The system currently treats derived and acquired information as complementary, but important questions remain:

- **Confidence-based weighting**: How should we weight information based on the confidence metrics from different sources?
- **Context-dependent prioritization**: When should we prioritize derived over acquired information or vice versa?
- **Contradiction resolution**: How do we resolve cases where derived and acquired information contradict each other?
- **Domain-specific considerations**: How do weighting strategies differ across domains (security vs. performance vs. maintainability)?

Possible solutions include:
- Bayesian belief networks that update confidence based on multiple information sources
- Domain-specific weighting coefficients derived from historical accuracy
- Human-in-the-loop resolution for high-stakes contradictions

### 2. Information Cohesion Across Source Types

Maintaining cohesive knowledge representation across different source types presents challenges:

- **Schema alignment**: How do we ensure consistent schema representation across derived and acquired data?
- **Temporal coherence**: How do we handle the evolution of information over time from different sources?
- **Mutual enrichment**: How can derived and acquired information mutually enhance each other?
- **Transfer learning**: Can patterns learned in one domain enhance analysis in another?

Research directions:
- Knowledge graph structures that explicitly model relationships between derived and acquired information
- Temporal versioning of information with provenance tracking
- Cross-training models on both derived and acquired data

### 3. Compensating for Missing Analysis Types

Not all environments will have access to all types of analysis:

- **Inference from partial information**: How do we infer what might have been found by unavailable analysis types?
- **Confidence adjustment**: How should we adjust confidence when key analysis types are missing?
- **Proxy signals**: What proxy signals can substitute for unavailable primary analyses?
- **Progressive enhancement**: How do we incrementally improve results as more analysis types become available?

Potential approaches:
- Synthetic data generation to simulate missing analysis outputs
- Multi-modal learning to predict one modality from another
- Confidence intervals that widen appropriately with missing data

### 4. Global Information Coherence Despite Local Gaps

Maintaining global information coherence despite local analysis gaps requires:

- **Information propagation**: How should findings from one component propagate to related components?
- **Default assumptions**: What default assumptions are safest when information is unavailable?
- **Context-aware inference**: How should context influence inferences about missing information?
- **Uncertainty representation**: How should we represent uncertainty in our knowledge model?

Research directions:
- Graph propagation algorithms for information flow across related components
- Explicitly modeling uncertainty using probability distributions rather than point estimates
- Sensitivity analysis to understand how missing information affects conclusions

### 5. Practical Implementation Strategies

To implement these concepts in practice, we should consider:

1. **Multi-level confidence scoring**: Track both the intrinsic confidence of the finding and meta-confidence based on information source
2. **Explicit provenance tracking**: Tag all information with its origin (derived/acquired) and derivation path
3. **Weighted ensemble methods**: Combine multiple analysis sources with learned weights
4. **Active learning**: Prioritize acquiring the most valuable missing information
5. **Progressive disclosure**: Present information with appropriate confidence indicators

## Architectural Implications

These research directions suggest several architectural patterns:

1. **Separation of concerns**: Keep derived and acquired information separate but linked
2. **Pipeline design**: Process information through stages that progressively refine confidence
3. **Pluggable analyzers**: Support multiple analysis techniques with a common interface
4. **Provenance tracking**: Maintain full history of how conclusions were reached
5. **Unified confidence model**: Use consistent confidence metrics across all analysis types

## Conclusion

The derived/acquired taxonomy provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding information quality and reliability. By explicitly modeling these distinctions and addressing the research questions above, we can build systems that make optimal use of all available information while maintaining appropriate levels of confidence in their conclusions.

This paradigm extends beyond security analysis to any domain where multiple information sources with different reliability characteristics must be integrated into a cohesive understanding.
