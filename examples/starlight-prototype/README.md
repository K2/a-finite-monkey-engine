# Starlight UI Prototype Components

This directory contains early versions of Starlight UI components that have been replaced by more advanced implementations in the main codebase.

## Components

### Pages
- **flow-analyzer.astro**: Original flow analyzer page without E2E encryption support
- **contracts.astro**: Early contract analysis page before security improvements
- **testing.astro**: Prototype testing interface
- **security.astro**: Initial security analysis dashboard
- **console.astro**: Python console interface before secure collaboration features

### UI Components
- **CollaborationPanel.jsx**: Original collaboration panel without E2E encryption
- **ChatInterface.jsx**: Basic chat interface without translation features
- **PyConsole.jsx**: Python console component before integration with secure sharing

### Utilities
- **translation.ts**: Generic translation utility replaced by specialized Chinese/English translation
- **collaboration.ts**: Initial collaboration utilities before implementing E2E encryption

### API Endpoints
- **translate.js**: Generic translation endpoint replaced by language-specific endpoints

## Improvements Made

The main codebase now includes:

1. **End-to-end encryption** for all collaborative features
2. **Specialized language support** optimized for Chinese/English users
3. **More secure data handling** patterns
4. **Better integration** with the Finite Monkey Engine analyzers
5. **Enhanced real-time collaboration** with WebSocket communication
6. **Improved UI components** with better user experience

These prototype components are maintained for documentation and reference only.
