# File Corruption Fixer Utility

## Issue Addressed

The vector_store_util.py file has experienced recurring corruption issues, specifically:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Malformed string literals, incomplete function calls, and misplaced code blocks
2. **Line Mixing**: Code from different parts of the file getting mixed together
3. **Error Handling Corruption**: Incomplete exception handlers and error logging statements

These issues make the file impossible to import and use, halting all vector store operations.

## Implementation Details

This utility script addresses these issues by:

1. **Creating Backups**: Makes timestamped backups before any modifications
2. **Syntax Validation**: Uses Python's AST parser to identify syntax errors
3. **Context Analysis**: Shows the lines surrounding the error for better diagnosis
4. **Automated Repairs**: Attempts to fix common corruption patterns:
   - Misplaced error handling blocks
   - Unmatched quotes and parentheses
   - Misplaced function/method definitions

## Usage

Run the script with the path to the corrupted file:

```bash
python tools/fix_corrupted_file.py tools/vector_store_util.py
```

The script will:
1. Create a backup copy
2. Identify syntax errors
3. Generate a fixed version as `vector_store_util.fixed.py`

After verifying the fixed file works correctly, you can replace the original.

## Prevention

To prevent future corruption:
1. Use version control (git) for all changes
2. Ensure proper error handling in file I/O operations
3. Validate file integrity after significant edits
4. Consider switching to a more robust editor with syntax validation
