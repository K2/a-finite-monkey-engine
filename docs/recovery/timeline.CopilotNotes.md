# Code Recovery Timeline

## Overview

This document tracks the recovery process of lost code from the a-finite-monkey-engine project following a git crash on March 26, 2025.

## Recovery Components

| Component | Status | Time Invested | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| LLMAdapter implementation | Recovered | ~30 min | Added missing `llm()` method that caused warnings |
| FLARE Query Engine | Recovered | ~45 min | Implemented complete engine with reasoning capabilities |
| Base Query Engine | Recovered | ~20 min | Core interface and result model restored |
| Existing Query Engine | Recovered | ~30 min | Compatibility layer for LlamaIndex integration |
| Script Adapter | Recovered | ~40 min | Tool for generating analysis scripts from queries |
| Factory Integration | Recovered | ~35 min | Connected pipeline factory to query engines |
| Debug Entry Point | Completed | ~45 min | Created comprehensive debugging pipeline script |
| Documentation | In Progress | Ongoing | ApiNotes.md files for all components |

## Lessons Learned

1. Creating regular commits, even for work-in-progress changes
2. Using branch-based development to preserve experimental work
3. Implementing comprehensive documentation in ApiNotes.md files that can aid recovery
4. Setting up automated backups beyond git
5. Using debugging entry points to validate recovered components

## Recovery Approach Effectiveness

| Approach | Effectiveness | Time Efficiency | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Manual code recreation | High | Medium | Most reliable but time-consuming |
| ApiNotes.md documentation | High | High | Greatly aided recovery by providing clear component descriptions |
| Debug entry point testing | High | High | Quickly validated recovered components together |
| Git reflog/history analysis | Low | Low | Limited by incomplete commits |
| Bytecode decompilation | Low | Low | Too time-consuming for complex code |

## Next Steps

1. Complete comprehensive testing of recovered components
2. Implement unit tests for critical components
3. Set up automated backup solutions
4. Create comprehensive documentation
5. Implement more regular commit discipline
