# Next Steps for Finite Monkey Engine

## Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Asynchronous Workflow Implementation**
   - Implemented the `run_atomic_agent_workflow` method in `orchestrator.py`
   - Ensured proper async/await usage in main workflow execution

2. **Added Claude API Integration**
   - Created `claude.py` adapter with full Anthropic API support
   - Implemented conditional imports to avoid requiring API key
   - Added support for different model selection
   - Created test script `test_claude_adapter.py` to verify Claude integration

3. **Updated Configuration**
   - Utilized existing `CLAUDE_API_KEY` configuration from `nodes_config.py`
   - Added automatic validation model selection based on model name

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix LlamaIndex Integration**
   - Resolve import issues with `llama_index` packages
   - Ensure correct versions of dependencies are installed
   - Update import paths to maintain compatibility

2. **Complete Claude Integration for Validation**
   - Test claude.py adapter with API key
   - Integrate with validator agent for improved validation quality
   - Add telemetry tracking for Claude API usage

3. **Task Manager Optimizations**
   - Implement task prioritization based on file size and complexity
   - Add rate limiting for API calls to external services
   - Improve error handling and retry strategies

## Medium-Term Roadmap

1. **Advanced Agent Architecture**
   - Implement Manager/Worker agent hierarchy with clear separation of concerns
   - Add agent self-testing capabilities for validation of performance
   - Create agent training/replay system to improve performance over time
   - Develop human-in-the-loop mechanisms for dynamic agent customization
   - Build agent observability system to capture error states and inefficiencies
   - Implement isolated workspaces with uv for handling code conflicts

2. **Parallel Multi-LLM Execution**
   - Develop dynamic resource allocation based on system capabilities
   - Create adaptive batching and prioritization for LLM calls
   - Implement "hatching" system for spinning up specialized agent instances
   - Add agent communication protocols for cross-model collaboration
   - Build fallback mechanisms when specific models are unavailable

3. **Distributed Execution**
   - Add support for distributing tasks across multiple nodes
   - Implement a coordinator for managing distributed workers
   - Add persistence for task queues across restarts
   - Create dynamic scaling based on workload complexity

4. **TreeSitter Pattern Matching**
   - Implement dynamic TreeSitter query interface
   - Create pattern mapping framework with map/reduce capabilities
   - Add user-defined detection functions as plugins
   - Build pattern library with common vulnerability signatures

5. **Web Interface Enhancements**
   - Add interactive graph visualization of agent workflow and state
   - Implement real-time monitoring of information flow between agents
   - Create visual representation of code comprehension progress
   - Add agent state exploration interface for debugging
   - Implement detailed telemetry dashboards for performance analysis
   - Add file browser for selecting contracts to analyze

## Testing Notes

To test the Claude adapter:

```bash
# Set your API key in the environment
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the test script
./test_claude_adapter.py

# Or specify prompt and model
./test_claude_adapter.py --model claude-3-haiku-20240307 --prompt "Explain reentrancy attacks in Solidity"
```
