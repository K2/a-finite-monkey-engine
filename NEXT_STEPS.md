## Testing Notes

To test the Claude adapter:

```bash
# Set your API key in the environment
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the test script
./test_claude_adapter.py

# Or specify prompt and model
./test_claude_adapter.py --model claude-3-haiku-20240307 --prompt "Explain reentrancy attacks in Solidity"
```
