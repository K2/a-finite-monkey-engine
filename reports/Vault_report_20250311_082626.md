## Audit Findings

#### Reentrancy Vulnerability (Severity: High)

**Description:** The withdraw() function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it performs an external call before updating the user's balance.

**Location:** withdraw() function

#### Missing Access Control (Severity: Critical)

**Description:** The destroyContract() function allows anyone to destroy the contract and send all funds to themselves.

**Location:** destroyContract() function

#### Dangerous Use of tx.origin (Severity: Medium)

**Description:** The isUser() function uses tx.origin for authentication, which is unsafe as it is vulnerable to phishing attacks.

**Location:** isUser() function

## Recommendations

- Implement proper access controls
- Use nonReentrant modifier on withdraw()
- Replace tx.origin with msg.sender
