# GitIgnore Pattern Best Practices

## Pattern Syntax

The `.gitignore` file supports several special patterns:

1. **`*` (asterisk)**: Matches zero or more characters, except `/`
   - Example: `*.pyc` matches all .pyc files in the current directory

2. **`**` (double asterisk)**: Matches zero or more directories
   - Example: `**/logs/**` matches all files within any logs directory anywhere in the repo

3. **`/` (forward slash)**:
   - If at the start: Limits pattern to the root directory
   - If at the end: Indicates the pattern is a directory
   - Example: `/node_modules/` only matches the node_modules directory in the root

4. **`!` (exclamation)**: Negates a pattern (exceptions to ignore rules)
   - Example: `*.log` with `!important.log` will ignore all .log files except important.log

## Pattern Order and Precedence

- Patterns are processed top-to-bottom
- Later rules override earlier ones
- More specific rules take precedence over general ones

## Efficiency Tips

1. **Use `**` for recursive matches, not repetitive patterns**
   - Better: `**/build/**`
   - Avoid: `build/`, `*/build/`, `*/*/build/`, etc.

2. **Group related patterns with comments**
   - This makes the file more maintainable for teams

3. **Place broader patterns higher**
   - Put specific exceptions below their corresponding broad rule

4. **Use directory indicators properly**
   - Add trailing `/` for directories: `logs/`
   - Without trailing `/`, the pattern matches files and directories

With these practices, your `.gitignore` will be more maintainable and effective at excluding unwanted files.
